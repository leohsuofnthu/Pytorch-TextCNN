# Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification

This is an Pytorch implementation of the paper [Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5882), the structure in this project is named as **CNN-non-static** in the paper. I wrap this model to facilitate anyone who want to train and validate their own dataset with TextCNN rapidly by preparing certain format of *.csv* file and providing parameters from users.

## Getting Started

Follow the following section to conduct your sentimental analysis experiments.

### Environment

This project is developed under following enviroment:

```
python 3.6
pytorch 1.2.0
torchtext 0.4.0
numpy 1.16.5
pandas 0.25.1
spacy 2.1.8
```

### Format of .csv file

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
